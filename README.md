Fund-O-Mat provides a simple and minimalistic way to accept tips via the Bitcoin
Lightning Network on your website and visualize the progress on funding goals.
It is written in PHP and Javascript with the utilization of
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and is heavily based on the great work of
[dmichael1011](https://github.com/michael1011/lightningtip) and
[robclark56](https://github.com/robclark56/lightningtip-PHP). Without you this
probably wouldn't exist, so thank you.
